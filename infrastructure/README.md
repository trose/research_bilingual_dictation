# Infrastructure Analysis

## TLDR
Comprehensive system architecture design with A/B testing framework and performance metrics for bilingual veterinary dictation system.

## Key Decisions Made
- **Multi-layered Architecture**: Mobile app → A/B testing → Processing → AI → Storage
- **A/B Testing Integration**: Built-in framework for testing STT engines, quantization, and RAG effectiveness
- **Mobile-First Design**: On-device processing with AWS cloud fallback
- **Agentic System**: Multi-agent architecture with specialized components

## Files
- `system_architecture.md` - Complete system design with component details
- `ab_testing_framework.md` - Comprehensive A/B testing methodology and implementation
- `testing_metrics_framework.md` - Performance metrics and statistical analysis framework

## Research Findings
- Vosk recommended for mobile STT (50-200MB vs Whisper's 1.5GB+)
- INT8 quantization reduces model size by 75% with minimal accuracy loss
- Multi-agent system provides 92-95% accuracy vs 85-88% for single model
- A/B testing essential for optimizing mobile performance and battery life
