## Questions for You

### Technical Clarifications
1. **Accuracy Validation**: How do you want to validate the 99.999% accuracy? Through veterinary expert review, automated testing, or both?
 - both, we should collect our "long tail" edge cases that fail, tag them, and use for future validation testing.

2. **AWS Services**: Do you have preferences for specific AWS services (SageMaker, Bedrock, Lambda, etc.) or should I research the optimal stack?
 - lambda for api layer. will bedrock host our own trained LLM or just frontier models?

3. **Device Testing**: Do you have access to the target devices (Galaxy S25 Ultra, Pixel, iPhone) for testing, or should we plan for cloud-based device testing?
 - we'll have physcial test devices

4. **Veterinary Expertise**: Which veterinary organizations or experts do you have access to for validation and partnership discussions?
 - dont know right now

### Business Clarifications
1. **Clinic Size**: What size clinics are you targeting? Small (2-5 vets), medium (5-20 vets), or large (20+ vets)?
 - small - medium

2. **Integration Priority**: Which existing clinic systems should we prioritize for integration (PIMS, scheduling, billing, etc.)?
 - PIMS but hold off planning that.

3. **Partnership Timeline**: When do you want to start reaching out to veterinary organizations for partnerships?
 - dont worry abbout it

4. **Pilot Program**: How many clinics would you like to include in the initial pilot program?
 - 500

### Development Clarifications
1. **Sub-Agent Framework**: Do you have a preferred sub-agent coordination system, or should I design one from scratch?
 - claude flow

2. **Development Environment**: What's your preferred development setup for the sub-agents?
 - claude flow
3. **Testing Strategy**: How do you want to handle testing across multiple devices and platforms?
 - testflight annd equivalent for android

4. **Deployment Strategy**: Do you want to start with a specific platform (iOS, Android) or develop for both simultaneously?
 - ios but later

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Start with Task 1 (Device-Specific Optimization) and Task 2 (Five 9s Accuracy Architecture)
2. **This Week**: Complete Tasks 1-4 (immediate follow-up tasks)
3. **Next Week**: Begin Tasks 5-7 (short-term tasks)
4. **Ongoing**: Continue with technical implementation tasks based on priority

Would you like me to start with any specific tasks, or do you have answers to the clarifying questions that would help prioritize the work?
