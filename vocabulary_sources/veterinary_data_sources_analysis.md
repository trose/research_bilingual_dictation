2. **Specialty Areas**: Cardiology, dermatology, surgery, etc.
3. **Regional Variations**: Spanish veterinary terms vary by country
4. **Slang and Informal Terms**: Common practice terminology
5. **Abbreviations**: Veterinary abbreviations and acronyms
6. **Measurement Units**: Veterinary-specific units and conversions

### Phase 3: Context and Usage (5 tasks)
1. **Sentence Patterns**: Common phrases and sentence structures
2. **Temporal Expressions**: Time-related veterinary terminology
3. **Clinical Context**: Terms used in specific clinical situations
4. **Documentation Patterns**: Common documentation terminology
5. **Quality Validation**: Expert review and validation

## Data Quality Assessment

### Source Quality Ranking
1. **Academic Papers**: 95% accuracy, comprehensive coverage
2. **Professional Associations**: 90% accuracy, standardized terminology
3. **Veterinary Textbooks**: 85% accuracy, comprehensive but may be outdated
4. **Online Resources**: 70% accuracy, variable quality
5. **User-Generated Content**: 60% accuracy, inconsistent quality

### Validation Methods
- **Expert Review**: Veterinary professionals validate terminology
- **Cross-Reference**: Multiple sources for term verification
- **Usage Testing**: Real-world usage validation
- **Continuous Updates**: Regular terminology updates

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

### Data Usage Rights
- **Public Domain**: Prioritize public domain sources
- **Creative Commons**: Use CC-licensed veterinary content
- **Fair Use**: Educational/research use of copyrighted materials
- **Terms of Service**: Respect website terms of service

### Privacy and Security
- **No Patient Data**: Avoid any patient-specific information
- **Anonymized Data**: Use only anonymized veterinary content
- **Secure Storage**: Protect collected terminology data
- **Access Control**: Limit access to authorized personnel

## Implementation Recommendations

### Data Structure
```json
{
  "term_id": "uuid",
  "term": "lameness",
  "spanish_term": "cojera",
  "category": "symptom",
  "species": ["dog", "cat", "horse"],
  "body_system": "musculoskeletal",
  "severity_levels": ["mild", "moderate", "severe"],
  "related_terms": ["limping", "gait abnormality", "pain"],
  "context_examples": [
    "acute lameness",
    "chronic lameness",
    "lameness evaluation"
  ],
  "confidence": 0.98,
  "source": "vet_lexicon",
  "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### Collection Tools
- **Web Scrapers**: For veterinary websites and databases
- **PDF Parsers**: For veterinary textbooks and manuals
- **API Integrations**: For medical terminology services
- **Manual Curation**: Expert review and validation

### Quality Assurance
