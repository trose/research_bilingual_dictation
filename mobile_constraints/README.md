## TLDR

Mobile deployment faces significant constraints but is achievable with strategic optimization:

**Key Constraints:**
- **Processing Power**: ARM processors can handle optimized models (1-3s inference)
- **Memory**: 4-8GB RAM sufficient with optimization (200-500MB for models)
- **Battery**: 2-4W power consumption manageable with efficient processing
- **Storage**: 1GB total system size achievable with quantization

**Optimization Strategies:**
- Model quantization (INT8/INT4) for 75% size reduction
- Hardware acceleration (NPU/GPU) when available
- Hybrid local-cloud processing for complex tasks
- Efficient memory management and streaming

**Recommendation**: Vosk-based approach with veterinary fine-tuning and RAG enhancement for optimal mobile performance.
