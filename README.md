# Bilingual Veterinary Dictation System Research

## Project Overview
Research and design for a veterinarian-specific dictation system supporting English and Spanish with specialized localLLM capabilities for speech-to-text and veterinary vocabulary comprehension.

## Research Objectives
1. **Bilingual Support**: English and Spanish dictation comprehension
2. **Veterinary Specialization**: Domain-specific vocabulary and terminology
3. **Mobile Native**: LocalLLM deployment on mobile devices
4. **Data Storage**: Audio, text, and vectorized meaning storage
5. **Agentic Architecture**: Specialized localLLMs working in coordination

## Key Research Areas
- [ ] Veterinary vocabulary sources and data collection
- [ ] LocalLLM vs RAG/MCP approach comparison
- [ ] Mobile deployment constraints and solutions
- [ ] Infrastructure design and architecture
- [ ] Data models for dictation storage
- [ ] Agentic system design patterns
- [ ] Cost analysis for OSS/cheap solutions

## Research Methodology
- Thought-tree process for solution exploration
- Parallel sub-agent research deployment
- Comprehensive comparison and decision matrices
- Assumption validation and hole-poking
