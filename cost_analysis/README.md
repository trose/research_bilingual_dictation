# Cost Analysis

## TLDR
Resource analysis for bilingual veterinary dictation system development, focusing on technical requirements and implementation approach.

## Key Decisions Made
- **Phased Development**: Three-phase approach with incremental complexity
- **Open Source Foundation**: Leverage existing tools to minimize development costs
- **Mobile Optimization**: Focus on efficient resource utilization
- **Dual Product Strategy**: Dictation system + PyVetTermino API
