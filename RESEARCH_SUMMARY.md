## Clarifying Questions

### Technical Questions
1. **Target Devices**: What are the minimum mobile device specifications?
  
    - We should support the majority of phones. "The Samsung Galaxy series dominates the US Android market, with models like the Galaxy S25 Ultra and various S21 and S10 models being very popular. Google Pixel phones also hold significant popularity, especially among Google's offerings. While Apple holds a majority overall, Samsung consistently leads in the Android segment within the United States"
2. **Accuracy Requirements**: What level of veterinary terminology accuracy is acceptable?
    - 90-95% is NOT acceptable for clinical use. we should aim to deliver five 9s accuracy and audit our logs to validate that ongoing.
3. **Offline Requirements**: How critical is 100% offline operation?
    - It would be most ideal for this to remain 100% offline but our budget should allow for API calls to Saas solutions if it would ensure high accuracy.
4. **Language Priority**: Should we focus on English first, then Spanish?
    - Sure. sounds like the english veterinary data is more complete

### Business Questions
1. **Target Market**: Are you targeting individual veterinarians or clinics?
    - clinics
2. **Competition**: How do you plan to differentiate from HappyDoc.ai?
    - shhh I'm applying to HappyDoc
3. **Monetization**: What's your preferred business model?
    - Saas? This is a theoretical product. you dont need to do business model evaluation right now.
4. **Timeline**: What's your target launch timeline?
    - Your timeline estimations are way too long. we're going to write this with subagents in parallel so tasks will be done quickly. individual implementation Tasks usually take a sub-agent minutes with large features done in hours.

### Resource Questions
1. **Budget**: What's your development budget range?
    - $20-50k/ month. BUT consider savings when possible.
