# Global Task Generation Rule

## Rule: Generate Task Lists Based on Actual Work Required

**NEVER** generate arbitrary numbers of tasks (like always 6, 5, or 10).

**ALWAYS** generate task lists based on:
1. **Actual complexity** of the work required
2. **Natural work breakdown** of the phase/component
3. **Realistic scope** of each individual task
4. **Dependencies** and logical groupings

## Examples of Natural Task Counts:
- **Simple data collection**: 3-4 tasks
- **Complex system design**: 8-12 tasks  
- **Basic testing**: 4-6 tasks
- **Comprehensive research**: 6-15 tasks
- **Simple implementation**: 2-5 tasks
- **Complex integration**: 7-10 tasks

## Quality Criteria:
- Each task should be **meaningful and specific**
- Tasks should **logically group** related work
- **No artificial padding** to reach a target number
- **No arbitrary truncation** to fit a pattern
- **Natural work flow** from start to finish

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid:
- ❌ Always generating exactly 6 tasks
- ❌ Padding with trivial tasks
- ❌ Combining unrelated work into single tasks
- ❌ Breaking single logical tasks into multiple parts
- ❌ Using round numbers as targets

## Success Metrics:
- Task count varies naturally based on complexity
- Each task represents meaningful work
- Tasks flow logically from one to the next
- No artificial patterns in task generation
