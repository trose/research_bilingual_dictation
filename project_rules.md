# Project Rules for Bilingual Veterinary Dictation System Research

## Core Constraints
1. **Budget**: All infrastructure and libraries must be free, OSS, or cheap
2. **Mobile First**: System must run natively on mobile devices
3. **Bilingual**: Support English and Spanish dictation
4. **Veterinary Specialized**: Domain-specific vocabulary and terminology
5. **Local Processing**: LocalLLM for speech-to-text functionality
6. **Data Storage**: Audio files, text transcripts, and vectorized meanings

## Research Methodology Rules
1. **Thought-Tree Process**: Explore all possible solutions before making decisions
2. **Parallel Research**: Deploy sub-agents to address tasks simultaneously
3. **Assumption Validation**: Actively poke holes in assumptions
4. **Decision First**: Make decisions based on research, then ask clarifying questions
5. **Comprehensive Comparison**: Use decision matrices for solution evaluation

## Technical Research Rules
1. **OSS Priority**: Prefer open-source solutions over proprietary
2. **Mobile Constraints**: Consider battery life, storage, and processing limitations
3. **Scalability**: Design for potential multi-user deployment
4. **Privacy**: Local processing preferred over cloud services
5. **Accuracy**: Veterinary terminology accuracy is critical

## Data Collection Rules
1. **API First**: Prefer APIs over scraping when available
2. **Structured Data**: Prioritize structured data sources (JSON, XML, CSV)
3. **Documentation**: Document all data sources and collection methods
4. **Legal Compliance**: Ensure data collection follows terms of service
5. **Quality Over Quantity**: Focus on high-quality, authoritative sources

## Architecture Rules
1. **Modular Design**: Separate concerns into distinct components
2. **Agentic Approach**: Consider specialized localLLMs for different tasks
3. **Fault Tolerance**: Design for offline operation and error recovery
4. **Performance**: Optimize for mobile device constraints
5. **Extensibility**: Design for future language additions

## Research Documentation Rules
1. **Source Attribution**: Document all research sources
2. **Decision Rationale**: Explain why specific solutions were chosen
3. **Alternative Analysis**: Document rejected alternatives and reasons
4. **Implementation Notes**: Include implementation considerations
5. **Cost Analysis**: Include cost estimates for all components

## Quality Assurance Rules
1. **Peer Review**: Have research reviewed by domain experts when possible
2. **Validation**: Test assumptions with real-world data when available
3. **Iteration**: Allow for research iteration based on new findings
4. **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive research documentation
5. **Reproducibility**: Ensure research can be reproduced by others
