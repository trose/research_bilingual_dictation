# Model Quantization Guide for LocalLLM Deployment

## What is Model Quantization?

Model quantization is a technique that reduces the precision of model parameters (weights and activations) to decrease model size and computational requirements while maintaining acceptable accuracy. Think of it as "compressing" the model by using fewer bits to represent each number.

## How Quantization Works

### Precision Levels
**Original (FP32)**: 32-bit floating point numbers
- **Size**: 4 bytes per parameter
- **Range**: ~3.4 × 10³⁸ to ~3.4 × 10⁻³⁸
- **Precision**: Very high precision

**Quantized (INT8)**: 8-bit integers
- **Size**: 1 byte per parameter (75% reduction!)
- **Range**: -128 to 127
- **Precision**: Lower but often sufficient

**Quantized (INT4)**: 4-bit integers
- **Size**: 0.5 bytes per parameter (87.5% reduction!)
- **Range**: -8 to 7
- **Precision**: Much lower, requires careful calibration

## Quantization Types

### 1. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ)
**Process**: Quantize a pre-trained model without retraining
**Pros**: 
- Fast and easy to implement
- No additional training required
- Immediate size reduction

**Cons**:
- May have accuracy loss
- Less optimal than training-aware quantization

**Example**:
```python
# Original model: 1.5GB
# After INT8 quantization: 400MB (73% reduction)
# Accuracy loss: 2-5%
```

### 2. Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)
**Process**: Train model with quantization in mind
**Pros**:
- Better accuracy preservation
- Model learns to work with lower precision
- More robust quantization

**Cons**:
- Requires retraining
- More complex implementation
- Longer development time

**Example**:
```python
# Original model: 1.5GB
# After QAT INT8: 400MB
# Accuracy loss: 0.5-2% (much better!)
```

### 3. Dynamic Quantization
**Process**: Quantize weights but keep activations in FP32
**Pros**:
- Good balance of speed and accuracy
- Easier to implement
- Moderate size reduction

**Cons**:
- Less aggressive size reduction
- Still requires FP32 for activations
