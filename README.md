- **Cloud Integration**: AWS services for accuracy validation and fallback
- **PyVetTermino RAG**: Comprehensive veterinary terminology API with semantic search

## Performance Targets
- **Processing Time**: <3 seconds end-to-end
- **Accuracy**: 99.999% for veterinary terminology
- **Battery Impact**: <5% per hour of use
- **Model Size**: <1GB total system size (75% reduction via quantization)
- **Offline Capability**: 100% with AWS fallback

## System Architecture

### Core Components
- **Mobile Application Layer**: User interface, audio capture, settings, data viewer
- **A/B Testing Layer**: Variant routing, test configuration, metrics collection
- **Processing Layer**: Audio preprocessing, speech-to-text, language detection
- **AI Processing Layer**: Veterinary LLM, PyVetTermino RAG, output processing, agents
- **Data Storage Layer**: Audio storage, text storage, vector database, test data

### Data Flow
```
Audio Input → Preprocessing → Speech-to-Text → Language Detection → 
Veterinary Processing → PyVetTermino RAG → Output Generation → 
Storage → User Display
```


## PyVetTermino: Veterinary Terminology API/SDK

### Product Overview
PyVetTermino is a comprehensive veterinary terminology platform inspired by [PyMedTermino](https://pypi.org/project/PyMedTermino/), designed specifically for the animal health domain. This standalone product can be licensed independently and serves as the foundation for our dictation system's terminology capabilities.

### Key Features
- **Comprehensive Terminology**: 100,000+ veterinary terms across all species and specialties
- **Multi-Language Support**: English, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Italian
- **RAG Integration**: Advanced semantic search with vector embeddings
- **Multi-Platform SDKs**: Python, JavaScript, Java, C#, Go
- **RESTful API**: Developer-friendly API with comprehensive documentation
- **Open Source Core**: LGPLv3+ licensed with commercial tiers

### Licensing Model
- **Open Source Core**: Free core library with LGPLv3+ license
- **Commercial Tiers**: Starter, Professional, and Enterprise licensing options
- **Multi-Platform SDKs**: Python, JavaScript, Java, C#, Go

## A/B Testing Framework

### Testing Objectives
- **Speech-to-Text Comparison**: Vosk vs Whisper performance evaluation
- **Model Quantization Impact**: INT8 vs INT4 vs FP16 quantization effects
- **RAG System Effectiveness**: Impact of PyVetTermino RAG on accuracy and processing time
- **Agentic vs Single Model**: Multi-agent vs monolithic approach comparison

### Key Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Veterinary terminology recognition accuracy (target: 99.999%)
- **Processing Time**: End-to-end processing latency (target: <3 seconds)
- **Battery Impact**: Power consumption per dictation session (target: <5% per hour)
- **User Satisfaction**: Subjective quality ratings and feedback

## Deployment Architecture

### Deployment
- **Mobile-First**: On-device processing with local models
- **Cloud Fallback**: AWS services for complex cases and validation
- **Security**: AES-256 encryption, biometric authentication
- **Privacy**: Complete offline operation with user data ownership
