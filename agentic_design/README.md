# Agentic Design Analysis

## TLDR
Analysis of multi-agent system architecture for bilingual veterinary dictation, comparing agentic vs single model approaches.

## Key Decisions Made
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: 5 specialized agents for different processing tasks
- **Agent Coordination**: Centralized coordination manager for agent communication
- **Hybrid Approach**: Start with single model, evolve to multi-agent system
- **Performance Trade-off**: 92-95% accuracy vs 85-88% for single model (3-4x complexity cost)

## Files
- `agentic_system_analysis.md` - Comprehensive multi-agent system design and analysis

## Research Findings
- **Agentic System**: Higher accuracy but significantly increased complexity
- **Single Model**: Simpler implementation, lower resource requirements
- **Recommended Approach**: Start with single model, add agents incrementally
- **Agent Types**: Speech Processing, Language Detection, Veterinary Specialist, Output Formatting, Quality Assurance
- **Coordination**: Centralized manager handles agent communication and task distribution
