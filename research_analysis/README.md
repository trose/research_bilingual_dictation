## TLDR

This directory consolidates all research findings that validate the feasibility of building a bilingual veterinary dictation system. Key findings include:

- ✅ **Viable**: Veterinary vocabulary sources, LocalLLM approaches
- ⚠️ **Challenging**: Mobile deployment, agentic approaches (higher complexity/cost)
- ❌ **Invalidated**: Some initial assumptions about simplicity

The research confirms the project is technically feasible but requires significant optimization and strategic implementation choices.
