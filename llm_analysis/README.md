# LLM Analysis

## TLDR
Comprehensive analysis of speech-to-text technologies and localLLM approaches for mobile veterinary dictation, with focus on Vosk vs Whisper comparison and model optimization strategies.

## Key Decisions Made
- **Primary STT Engine**: Vosk for mobile deployment (lightweight, offline-capable)
- **Fallback Option**: Whisper for high-accuracy scenarios (cloud processing)
- **Model Quantization**: INT8/INT4 quantization for 75% size reduction
- **Architecture**: Hybrid approach combining fine-tuned models with RAG system

## Files
- `speech_to_text_comparison.md` - Detailed comparison of Vosk, Whisper, and Kaldi
- `localLLM_analysis.md` - Analysis of localLLM deployment strategies and constraints
- `model_quantization_guide.md` - Quantization techniques and performance impact

## Research Findings
- **Vosk**: 50-200MB models, 85-90% accuracy, 1-2s processing time, low battery impact
- **Whisper**: 1.5GB+ models, 95%+ accuracy, 2-5s processing time, high battery impact
- **Mobile Optimization**: Whisper.cpp and quantization can reduce Whisper to 74-244MB
- **Veterinary Performance**: Both engines struggle with specialized terminology (80-90% accuracy)
- **Recommendation**: Vosk for mobile + fine-tuned veterinary model + RAG enhancement
