# Technical Analysis

This directory contains technical analysis and design documents for system architecture and implementation approaches.

### System Design
- **`agentic_design/`** - Agentic system analysis and multi-agent architecture design
  - `agentic_system_analysis.md` - Comprehensive analysis of agentic approaches for veterinary dictation

## TLDR

This directory contains technical analysis of advanced system architectures, particularly focusing on agentic approaches that could improve accuracy and specialization but with increased complexity. The analysis shows that while agentic systems can achieve 92-95% accuracy (vs 85-88% for single models), they require 3-4x higher development and maintenance costs.
